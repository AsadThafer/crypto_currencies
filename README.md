https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false

Create global header having three navigation links (Home, Crypto Currencies and Trend)
Home page: should have an images slider for each currency image and name
Crypto Currencies page: should have a table of all currencies data, add search field on top of the table to search currency name.

No specific UI for this, do your best to have suitable style.

### Task 3 

You should incorporate SASS (with Bootstrap) in your existing project (cryptocurrencies), your project should have many SASS files (split them per component or per page - ex: _tables.scss) compiled into one CSS file. Feel free to use any package to compile your SASS files.
