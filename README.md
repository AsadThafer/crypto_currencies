#Task 2

Please use this API to get a list of crypto currencies and do the following:

https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false

Create global header having three navigation links (Home, Crypto Currencies and Trend)
Home page: should have an images slider for each currency image and name
Crypto Currencies page: should have a table of all currencies data, add search field on top of the table to search currency name.
Trend Page: should have pie chart for currency name with current_price data

No specific UI for this, do your best to have suitable style.
